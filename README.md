# fem_2d_mesh_plot

A Mesh visualization tool for the [fem_2d](https://github.com/jeremiah-corrado/fem_2d) library. 

`fem_2d` allows mesh files to be exported in a json format compatible with this library:

```Rust
use fem_2d::prelude::*;

// load a raw mesh file (this is an alternate format, not compatible with this library)
let mut mesh = mesh::from_file("./input_files/some_mesh.json").unwrap();

// execute some refinements
mesh.set_global_expansion_orders([3, 4]).unwrap();
mesh.h_refine_elems(vec![0, 3, 4, 6], HRef::t()).unwrap();

// export the mesh file 
mesh.export_to_json("./output_files/refined_mesh.json").unwrap();
```

 This tool allows mesh files to be viewed in 3D, and exported as images.
